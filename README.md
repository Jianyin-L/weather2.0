# weather2.0
This project is developed using **python 3.8.2.** in a **Window** system using Oracle Virtual Machine. 

## Purpose
This is improved version of the ![weather project](https://github.com/Jianyin-L/weather)

It calculates
a. the *average temperature* for each city  
b. the *top three most common* "weather text" for each city 

To simulate a unbounded data stream, 0.json will be loop through infinitely.  
* The producer will publish a meesage in a fixed time interval.
